This is a common issue when you manually update your system's Python version.

Let's understand the problem:

When we install the python binding for apt (either python3-apt or python-apt), it places a shared object file within `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`. It might look like this:

```bash
apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```

Here, `310` is my python version, maybe your one will say `36m` *python-3.6* or maybe `38` *python-3.8*

Now, most of the times you'll see just one old obj file in that location. 
Say you had python 3.10 and you upgraded to 3.11. But inside `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` you'll see

```bash
    /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages ❯ ls -l | grep -i 'apt_pkg.c'
.rw-r--r--  351k root 30 Nov  2022  apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```

If you've been using the OS for a while, you might find more than one file:

```bash
    /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages ❯ ls -l | grep -i 'apt_pkg.c'
.rw-r--r--  351k root 30 Nov  2022  apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
.rw-r--r--  351k root 30 Nov  2022  apt_pkg.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
````

Now, what's happening is, there's no new obj file to point to our latest python binary.


## The solution,

We could create a symlink from the existing old image to `apt_pkg.so`. But since symlinks can be fragile and might break if the referenced file gets deleted, it's better to copy it directly as `apt_pkg.so`.

doing,

```bash
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```

will fix it. remember to put your image name there.

Now, if there are multiple old images, choose the closest to your python version

If there are `apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` and `apt_pkg.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`

select `apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`

When copying, if you encounter something like

```bash
cp: failed to access '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt_pkg.so': Too many levels of symbolic links
```

Simply unlink `apt_pkg.so` then run,

```bash
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```

Thsi should fix it :)
